# Coursera_IBM_Data_Visualization_with_Python

Data visualization plays an essential role in the representation of both small and large-scale data.

One of the key skills of a data scientist is the ability to tell a compelling story, visualizing data and findings in an approachable and stimulating way. 
Learning how to leverage a software tool to visualize data enabled me to extract information, better understand the data, and make more effective decisions.

The main goal of Data Visualization with Python course was to teach us how to take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that makes sense to people. 
Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but in this course,i used several data visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.
